# Older Project Repositories

- [Market Production Integrated Optimization](https://github.com/Zelong-Chen/Marketing-Production-Integrated-Optimization)
  - Integrated Marketing predictions and Production optimization into a single model that generates an optimal decision based on the predictions made by the Marketing but also account for the uncertainty from the predictions
  - Using techniques such as Sample Average Approximation and Stochastic Decomposition we were able to include the uncertainty from the linear regression predictions and generate an optimal decision that can then be validated

- [Disaggregation of Yelp Review Ratings](https://github.com/Zelong-Chen/Disaggregation-of-Yelp-Review-Ratings)
  - Conducted experiments to dissect the Yelp Overall Ratings into sub-categories of ratings that grant a better insight into the business’s performance then just one overall 5-star rating system
  - Implementation involves the use of TF-IDF and Non-negative Matrix Factorization to generate sub-categories from the user’s text reviews, Sentiment Intensity to generate the sub-categories’ individual ratings, and Linear Regression of ratings used for validation
